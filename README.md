# Graph Neural Networks for Social Recommendation

## Overview
This repository contains the research work on improving the performance of social aggregation in the paper titled "Graph Neural Networks for Social Recommendation". The project includes the implementation of the original paper, enhancements made to the social aggregation mechanism, and performance comparisons.


## Background
The original paper, "Graph Neural Networks for Social Recommendation," proposed a method to incorporate social information into the recommendation process using GNNs. We focused on improving the social aggregation mechanism to achieve better performance.
